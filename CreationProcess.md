### Update Aug 12
So far the program can complete steps 1 through 3 on the handout but I'm encountering a little difficulty with step 4. 

### Update Aug 14
I was able to complete step 4 by following the "How to Calculate a Coprime" instructions on the [Sciencing Website](https://sciencing.com/calculate-coprime-6921150.html). While jamming to some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AftvCIiYk5c), and searching Stack Overflow for a message from the Gods, I realized that it's possible to just iterate through the ArrayList! Through doing this I successfully solved my months old issue.

### Update Aug 15
I'm so close to completing this project I can just taste it! All I need to address now is steps 6-7 of the handout. I considered calculating the Private Decrypt Exponent by using the formula but that didn't get me anywhere. Tomorrow I'll try checking it against the coprimeFactorList and see what happens then! Until Then! 

### Update Aug 16
This project is now completed! I'm very proud of it! For the future I can consider implementing a GUI for this text input skeleton.
