# Public Key Encryptor
This is currently a work in progress public key encryption app.
Here's a screenshot of what the program can do so far:

This program was inspired by a handout from my Introduction to Information Security course. In class we covered how to manually find the private key and so I'm interested in implementing it via a computer program. So far the program can complete steps 1 through 3 but I'm encountering a little difficulty with step 4. 

Below is a screenshot of the handout:
